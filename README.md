# GottoGo
2D platform Game made with Unity.

Concept is simple... Just run as fast as you can and don't get caught by enemies, or spikes, or... water?

## Graphic is kinda old fashioned.

## Ideas
Game is still in progress so dont judge plz :') <br />
### My ideas for this game are:
- New background <br />
- New player sprite <br />
- More kind of enemies <br />
- More player mechanics, such as dashing,  double jumping <br />
- Collectives <br />
- Boss battles
